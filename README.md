# Quick Time--schedule-your-days
a htmls and css based quick app to access on pc, android and ios

Well ADHD peeps are growing exponentially, I am one of them :V 
This app should in theory help each of us, if we take our pills.

The main issue after taking a "Pill de focus" /j
is that we dont find a goal and just start focusing on what we see in front of us 
What the main issue is, this "thing" we see in front of us is not always "PRoductive" nor "Required to be done"
Countless days have gone like this.

But I started hanging big signs on "What I should do" and music has always been influential to me, so I always search for a good music before taking "le pill" and I want to replicate this for others.

Thank you. 

Readme will be updated as the Project progresses.
